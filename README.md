IFRS 17 Reporting App
This repository houses the development files for the IFRS 17 Reporting App. The app enables users to efficiently manage and generate meaningful reports on their company’s cash flow calculations, all in alignment with the IFRS 17 Standard. Developed and maintained by Actuartech (Dupro Ltd.), the app has evolved as a comprehensive tool for IFRS 17 reporting, offering a variety of advanced features for enhanced user experience and accurate financial insights.

App Architecture
The IFRS 17 Reporting App supports a full end-to-end pipeline that spans from uploading cash flow calculations to generating and visualizing results in the form of reconciliations, accounts, and disclosures— all formatted to meet the requirements under the IFRS 17 standard.

Key features and functionalities of the app include:

Multiple Measurement Models: The app supports the GMM (General Measurement Model), VFA (Variable Fee Approach), and PAA (Premium Allocation Approach), catering to a range of insurance products and their specific reporting requirements.

Cohorts, Products, and Sub-products: Easily manage and report on multiple insurance products, sub-products, and cohorts, with flexible data handling options.

Cloud Integration: Reports can be saved to the cloud, enabling access and management of past reports from any location at any time.

Data Filtering: The app includes advanced filtering features, allowing users to focus on precise fields and view custom reports based on their specific requirements.

Validation Checks: Built-in validation tools ensure accurate and error-free data entry and processing, providing users with guidance and ensuring compliance with IFRS 17 reporting standards.

Key Updates and Contributions
As part of the project, I contributed by updating the app’s architecture and enhancing its functionality in the following ways:

MySQL Database Integration: I connected the app to a MySQL database to handle large-scale data storage and processing, making it more efficient in calculating necessary values for IFRS 17 reports.

Optimized Data Handling: I worked on improving the way the app handles and processes complex actuarial data, ensuring that all calculations comply with IFRS 17 requirements and are processed accurately.

Enhanced Reporting: With the integration of MySQL, I enabled more dynamic and flexible reporting, offering improved performance when querying large datasets.

Learning Opportunity: This project gave me the opportunity to dive deeper into the intricacies of IFRS 17 standards, and gain hands-on experience with data management, actuarial calculations, and reporting in a real-world application.

Purpose of this Repository
This repository contains all the development files for the IFRS 17 Reporting App, and serves as a versioning and testing tool for ongoing development and updates.
